# Multi-armed bandit

This repo is for making experiments with a multi-armed bandit. You can evaluate the existing algorithms and implement your own. You can view the evaluations as plotly graphics. There is a post about this [on Medium](https://medium.com/@dimitri.rusin/dae780eb2fab).

# Quickstart

To initialize the project:
```sh
.deploy/BUILD
```

Hereby, you will create a new conda environment with the correct Python version and correct Python package versions. The entire conda environment will be placed into the path `.deploy/conda_environment/`.

To run the algorithms and create the visualizations:
```sh
.deploy/RUN
```

Hereby, algorithms will be evaluated and their graphics will be created. Graphics will be written as .png files into a newly created folder `./computed/`.

You're welcome!
